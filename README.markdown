# Megajewel

A Windows Forms application that uses Win32 API and DirectX hooks to play Bejeweled 3. It uses histogram classification to determine what jewels are displayed on-screen in order to determine what to click.

It scores over 4,000,000 points on Lightning Mode and reaches MAX levels and over 2,000,000 points on Diamond Mine.

Programmed in C#.

**The code is broken.** The SharpDX dependency that is used to get screenshots of Bejeweled to make this bot work doesn't compile anymore. I don't know why that is, but if you wish to run this bot, that is something that needs to be fixed.
